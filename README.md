# STC-root-vertex-transformation

## Project Overview
"STC-root-vertex-transformation" is a MATLAB-based project. By revising the traditional STC method and adding the function of updating the STC solution by changing the root vertex, scholars can develop their own quantitative representation to achieve their own satisfactory STC solution.
